This code consists of the things that I have learned as I follow the tutorials
on Siraj Raval's Learning Python for Data Science playlist.

He has weekly challenges at the end of each video, and I've done my best to 
update my code and go through with these challenges. This is a great way to
learn about Data Science in general.
